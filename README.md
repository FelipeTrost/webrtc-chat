## Steps
1. Choose wether to make an offer or recieve an offer
2. The person that chose to make an offer has to send it to the reciever
3. The reciever has to paste it in the "Recieve offer" field and click the "Recieve Offer"
4. The reciever will now get an answer, he has to send it to the offerer
5. The offerer has to paste the answer into the "Recieve offer" and click the "Recieve offer" button
6. Now both user have to exchange ice candidates: now both users have to copy the ice candidate list (there is a button for this) and send it to the other user, both have to paste into the "Recieve ice candidates list" field and click the "handle ice candidates" button

Great now you're live chatting with a friend :)
